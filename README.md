Pyloton: Open Source cycling computer that displays heart rate, speed, cadence, and song playback info

https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton

To stream sensor data from a Garmin sensor to Matlab or Python, it has in Matlab an instruction which is probably easy to make real for PhD in computer engineering. The Adafruit instruction CircuitPython BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display is a 33 pages when printed it out on my PC printer.

With Bitalino, you can pair an ECG devise via bluetooth to a PC running Matlab or Python directly. Why can Garmin BLE sensors not be paired directly to a PC?

I could not find an option to stream sensor data further to PC applications in the Adafruit apps, but circuits of the Adafruit Pytholon cycling computer are Arduino compatible. Arduinos can be connected over usb to Matlab. 

It maybe will take some time to go through the instruction of the Pyloton, but it is an extraordinary device in that sense that it is very rare to find a device which is open source in the field of sporting devices. It is a device, which you don t have to develop first, and the instruction is excellent.

Make yourself free from the dependency of Gamin. Read the 55 pages of instruction for the Pyloton Open Source Bike computer (pdf printout):

And build your own Pyloton. The only problem which is not descripted is how to read out sensor data from the Pyloton usb port. But this should be possible. There are many instructions for Matlab, Python or other PC applications how to connect to an Arduino through usb, and the Pyloton is Arduino compatible.

There is no real-time Open Source Data aquisiton software available for the Pyloton. Integration into OpenSignals?

My vision of the future of the Pyloton is:

1. A version of the Pyoton for the Rasperri PI would be great, to have a storage card device as a data grabber to store data in an easy accessible way, for instance in Matlab friendly .csv. 

2. Do you know the new Linux Pinephone? I don t have one yet, but I certainly buy one. It is a real Linux Smartphone computer. A version of the Pyloton for the Linux Pinephone would be my favorite: large display, repleacable batteries, easy to use Linux platform for software developement. 

All these things would make the Pyloton software project a great open source cycling computer which can compete with the latest bike computers from Garmin, or even beat them.
