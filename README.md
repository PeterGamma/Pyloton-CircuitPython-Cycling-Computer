Pyloton: Open Source cycling computer that displays heart rate, speed, cadence, and song playback info

To stream sensor data from a Garmin sensor to Matlab or Python, it has in Matlab an instruction which is probably easy to make real for PhD in computer engineering. The Adafruit instruction CircuitPython BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display is a 33 pages when printed it out on my PC printer.

With Bitalino, you can pair an ECG devise via bluetooth to a PC running Matlab or Python directly. Why can Garmin BLE sensors not be paired directly to a PC?

I could not find an option to stream sensor data further to PC applications in the Adafruit apps, but circuits of the Adafruit Pytholon cycling computer are Arduino compatible. Arduinos can be connected over usb to Matlab. 

It maybe will take some time to go through the instruction of the Pyloton, but it is an extraordinary device in that sense that it is very rare to find a device which is open source in the field of sporting devices. It is a device, which you don t have to develop first, and the instruction is excellent.
